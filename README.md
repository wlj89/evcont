# EVCont
This package bundles different scripts and tools for the application of the eigenvector continuation from few variational *ab initio* states, as discussed in our upcoming manuscript: Y. Rath and G. H. Booth. Interpolating many-body wave functions for accelerated molecular dynamics on near-exact electronic surfaces [1]


## Installation
The project comes with a pyproject.toml.
The utility functions from the [evcont](./evcont) folder can be installed from the main folder with

```
pip install -e .
```

This also ensures that the core dependencies (numpy, scipy, pyscf) are installed.

Additional optional dependencies are not installed automatically and need to be installed manually if required.

Optional dependencies include:
- [block2](https://github.com/block-hczhai/block2-preview): required for the continuation from MPS
- [pygnme](https://github.com/BoothGroup/pygnme/blob/master/README.md?plain=1): required for the continuation from CAS states
- [dscribe](https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe): Required for GAP predictions

## Code

This repository is merely a collection of utility functions and scripts for the eigenvector continuation (in particular, interfacing different codes).
The [evcont](./evcont) folder contains common helper functions and bundles the main utilities (which can be installed).
The [scripts](./scripts) folder contains scripts generate the data from our manuscript [1].
These should also serve as a good first point of entry into the general functionality of the codebase.

The following scripts are included:
 - [scripts/PES_H_chain/H6_PES/H6_continuation.py](./scripts/PES_H_chain/H6_PES/H6_continuation.py): Prediction of the PES for a 6-atom H chain from different training points as depicted in Fig. (1) of [1]
 - [scripts/PES_H_chain/H10_PES/H10_continuation_3D_replacements.py](./scripts/PES_H_chain/H10_PES/H10_continuation_3D_replacements.py): Script to generate the data from Fig. (2) of [1], generating the EVCont, HF and GAP predictions of PES and force field for distorted 10-atom Hydrogen chains based on symmetrically stretched training configurations.
 - [scripts/MD/H2O](./scripts/MD/H2O): Scripts to perform the MD simulation of the water molecule (results shown in Figs. (3), (7), and (8) of [1])
 - [scripts/MD/H30](./scripts/MD/H30): Scripts to perform the MD simulation of the 1D hydrogen chain with 30 atoms in a minimal basis (results shown in Figs. (4) and (9) of [1])
 - [scripts/MD/H2O-H3O+](./scripts/MD/H2O-H3O+): Scripts to perform the MD simulation of the Zundel cation complex in a 6-31G basis (results shown in Figs. (6) and (12) of [1])
 - [scripts/MD/Zundel_thermodynamics](./scripts/MD/Zundel_thermodynamics): Scripts to perform multi-trajectory MD simulations of the Zundel cation complex in a 6-31G basis for the extraction of room temperature thermodynamics (results shown in Figs. (5), (10), and (12) of [1])
